This project is a stub.
It is designed to replace the OSMFTest and the OSMFAirTest projects currently used for unit testing.
This project has a similar structure to StrobeMediaPlaybackTest and can be run automatically (it also provides test reports).
At the moment, three test suites are included as an example of how to convert the test suites from the OSMFTest project: 
	- org.osmf.containers.TestHTMLMediaContainer.as
	- org.osmf.containers.TestMediaContainer.as
	- org.osmf.media.TestMediaType.as
